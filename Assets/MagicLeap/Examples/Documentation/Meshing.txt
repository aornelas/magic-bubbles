# Example Scene: Meshing

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using the
meshing functionality. The example provides a SpatialMapper script that uses
its object transform data to drive parameters to the meshing API through
MLSpatiaMapper.

The scene provides several examples of changing the way rendering and physics
interact with the meshing results. You can:
- Visualize the mesh results.
- Use the mesh results as occlusion data for virtual objects.
- Toggle the bounds extents between bounded and unbounded and visualize the bounds with a wire frame cube.
- Shoot prefab spheres into the scene for physics interaction.

## Bumper
Cycles rendering modes:
- Wireframe. Wireframe mesh visualization from meshed results. Virtual objects
  are occluded.
- Occlusion. No visualization of mesh results.  Virtual objects are occluded.
- None.

## Home Button
Toggles the bounds extents:
  - Switch bounds between bounded and boundless
  - Bounds are represented by a clear wireframe cube where the user is at the center.

## Trigger
Shoot ball into the scene to demonstrate occlusion and physics.

## Touchpad

  - Switch amount of triangles per block between 250, 1000, 5000 and 20000
