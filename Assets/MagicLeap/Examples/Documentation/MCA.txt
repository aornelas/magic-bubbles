# Example Scene: MCA

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for receiving input
from a Mobile Companion Application (MCA).

When a MCA is connected, this example shows its status. A mobile phone model
shows the state of the buttons and touch input. This model follows your mobile device
with 3 DoF rotational data after calibration is completed -- positional data is not
available for MCA.

When an MCA is disconnected, the example updates the status UI. If a controller is
connected, the status UI also is updated accordingly. If a Control is connected,
this one gets ignored.

## Calibration
- Align your mobile device with the model on the scene
- Press the MCA Home Button
- Pressing when on calibration mode will apply calibration and model will
  start to follow MCA rotational data.
- Pressing when calibrated will enter calibration mode.

## Bumper - Bottom left button with 2 circles
When you press the Bumper:
- A ring around the bumper button on the mobile phone model lights up.

## Home Button - Bottom middle button with the house icon
When you release the Home Button:
- A ring around the home button on the mobile phone model lights up for a short duration.
- Calibration steps will get applied.

## Trigger - Bottom right button with the 4 arrows
When you press the Trigger button:
- A ring around the trigger button on the mobile phone model lights up.
- Note: the trigger value can only be 0 or 1 for the MCA.

## Touchpad - Grid at the center of the app
When you touch the Touchpad:
- The touchpad on the mobile phone model shows the touch location, similar to what you see on the
  actual MCA. A maximum of two touches can be detected.

## Keyboard - Tap the keyboard icon on the upper right corner
When you type on the Keyboard:
- Printable characters appear on the keyboard input (left side). Note: you have to tap
  **Submit** on the MCA.

  not require to tap Submit.
