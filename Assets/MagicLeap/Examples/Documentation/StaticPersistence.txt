# Example Scene: StaticPersistence

This examples shows usage of MLPersistentPoint MonoBehaviour which is a utility class that you can attach
to the GameObject and put your virtual objects underneath. This is how you can maintain persistence of
objects for objects created statically ()i.e. they are not dynamically added to the scene hierarchy).

MLPersistentPoint MonoBehaviour provides a high degree of resilience because the component associates
your object with more than one Persistent coordinate frames (PCFs) thereby improveing the chances of
restoration on boot.

The two balls you see in the scene should persist in the same location between device boots. Please
note that the object that is really persisting is the parent of the two balls. The balls restore by 
maintaining their relative locations with respect to their parent in the scene.
