# Example Scene: Light Tracking

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using light
tracking and observing the luminance level within a scene.

Located in the top right is a luminance level indicator, and will update
based on the light conditions in your environment.

Based on the lighting conditions, the plant model will either grow
or retracted back into the planter. You should also notice the
ambient intensity change in the scene as well.

You can use the controller (Bumper) to anchor / move the plant model
to various locations in your environment.

## Bumper
Toggles the (anchor / movement) of the plant model.
